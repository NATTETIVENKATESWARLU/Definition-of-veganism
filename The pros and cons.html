    <h1><mark>1. Vegan foods are rich in the nutrients your body needs.</mark></h1>
    <img src="./image/vegan-avo 1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>You can get all the nutrients you need from a healthy, balanced vegan diet rich in wholefoods including fruits, vegetables, pulses, grains, nuts, and
     seeds. Several studies
     have reported that people who eat vegan tend to consume more fibre, antioxidants, potassium, magnesium, folate, and vitamins A, C, and E.</p>

     <h1><mark>2. Eating vegan helps reduce our risk of suffering from cancer and other diseases.</mark></h1>
     <img src="./image/family 2.jpg" alt="">
     <p>A recent study suggests that eating vegan can help reduce our risk for disease, as plant-based foods are packed with phytochemicals – including the powerful antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables. Researchers found that vegans had higher concentrations of antioxidant carotenoids, a higher proportion of total omega-3 fatty acids, and
     lower levels of saturated fatty acids than non-vegans, all of which are linked to positive health outcomes.
     An 11-year German study involving more
     than 800 vegetarian men also found that their cancer rates were less than half those of the general public.</p>

     <h1><mark>3.Vegan food can boost your mood.</mark></h1>
     <img src="./image/goodmood 3.jpg" alt="">
     <p>It’s a given that following a compassionate lifestyle that avoids harming animals will give you a clearer conscience, and studies show that vegans may actually be happier than meat-eaters.
     In fact, vegans and vegetarians had better scores on depression tests and mood profiles than those who ate fish and meat.</p>


     <h1><mark>4. Eating vegan can help you achieve a healthy body weight.</mark></h1>
     <img src="./image/weight 4.jpg" alt="">
     <p>Vegan foods tend to be lower in calories than animal-derived ones, making it easier to achieve a healthy body weight without actively focusing on cutting calories. Most vegan foods contain significantly less saturated fat than animal “products” do, \
    and many studies have shown that vegans tend to have lower body mass indexes than non-vegans.</p>


    <h1><mark>5. It can help prevent type 2 diabetes.</mark></h1>
    <img src="./image/sugar 5.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Research has shown that people who eat vegan tend to have lower blood sugar levels than non-vegans and may reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 78%. Consuming plenty of healthy plant-based foods can also help mitigate the risk factors 
    associated with developing diabetes, such as obesity.</p>


    <h1><mark>6. Your skin may benefit, too.</mark></h1>
    <img src="./image/face1 6.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Who doesn’t want a glowing complexion? When it comes to skin issues, one of the worst culprits is dairy – multiple studies have shown that dairy consumption exacerbates acne in both men and women. Aside from ditching dairy, vegans typically eat more fruit and vegetables, which means they
     get more of the good stuff that’s needed for healthy skin, such as antioxidants and vitamins.</p>


     <h1><mark>7. Eating vegan can reduce the pain of arthritis.</mark></h1>
     <img src="./image/hands 7.jpg" alt="">
     <p>Studies have shown that a diet high in healthy vegan foods can help reduce the symptoms of arthritis, since consuming animal-derived foods is linked to pain-causing inflammation. Eating probiotic plant-based foods such as fermented vegetables and non-dairy yogurts with live cultures can boost the good 
    bacteria in the large intestine, also helping to boost nutrient absorption and reduce inflammation.</p>
     
    <h1><mark>Cons of a Vegan Diet</mark></h1>
    <p>Potential Nutrient Deficiencies — A vegan diet may lack certain essential nutrients such as vitamin B12, iron, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein. It's crucial to carefully plan your diet to ensure you get all necessary nutrients.
        Challenges in Eating Out — Finding suitable vegan options can be difficult, especially in non-vegan-friendly areas. Dining out may require extra effort and research to identify vegan-friendly restaurants and menu items.
        Social Limitations — Being vegan might pose social challenges during gatherings or events, as not everyone may understand or accommodate dietary preferences. These situations can sometimes be uncomfortable.
        Initial Learning Curve — Transitioning to a vegan diet may require learning new recipes, understanding ingredient alternatives, and familiarizing yourself with plant-based nutrition. This learning curve may feel overwhelming initially.
        Potential Expense — While a plant-based diet can be affordable, specialty vegan products and substitutes can be more expensive than their non-vegan counterparts. Organic or specialty items may strain your budget.</p>
